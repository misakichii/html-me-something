            <p>In 2016 my friends and I decided it was time. Time to visit one of the Disney theme parks located in Tokyo. 
            Since at the time we all lived on the outskirts of Tokyo for study abroad. We figured that it would be fairly 
            easy to go. We met at 5 am near where I lived at the time it would take a one hour train ride standing the enitre way to the 
            Yokohama station where we would get on a charter bus and ride for another hour to get there.</p>

            <h2>Beautiful on the inside</h2>
            <p>Once inside the park its beautiful. Right at the entrance there is a big golden ship crewed by Donald Duck's nephews Huey, Dewey and Louis. 
            a very large globe.  We were also greeted by a street performance to the left of the entrance. We paused for a few minutes to watch before continuing
            on to find the first ride we wanted to take. Unfortunately for us alot of the rides were not open when we went. We did however get to ride on the
            Tower of Terror after waiting well over an hour just to get inside of the building and almost another hour to get on the actual ride. </p>

            <h2>what are the best rides?</h2>
            <p>After I found out about the wait time, I knew we were going to have to be extra strategic about which rides to go on! 
            I started doing some research on the rides and ended up with a goal of 8 rides for us!! We did about 5 or 6 I think, 
            which was more than enough for me :) Here are the rides I suggest: Tower of Terror (please not our faces above HAHA), 
            Toy-story Mania, Aquatopia (also have a New finding Nemo Ride), Indian Jones (a classic), Raging Spirits ( we didn‚Äôt 
            make it on this one), Journey To The Center Of the Earth (best ride in the park), and if you have kids, check out the Jumping 
            Jellyfish in the Little Mermaid world!</p>

            <h2>Does each ride really have a wait time of two hours?</h2>
            <p>Say it anint so! When I was doing my pre-travel research I stumbled upon a blog post that told me to prepare for 2 HOUR 
            wait times at almost every ride. I did not want to believe it‚Ä¶ until I was experiencing it my self! Our first ride of the day, 
            Journey To The Center Of The Earth, had 140 minuet wait time when we hopped in line üëçüèº I will say with good company the lines 
            move pretty fast :) but for the rest of the day we took advantage of the Single Rider and only waited for a few rides we knew 
            we wanted to sit together on! There really is no way to avoid this due to the popularity of the Park. Unless you arrive VERY early for Fast Passes. </p>

            <h2>Fast passes 101</h2>
            <p>Just like any of the Parks, Fast Passes are available here for free! At any participating ride, there will be a Fast Pass 
            Kiosk in front. You simply enter your park ticket into the machine and a Fast Pass Ticket Will print off for you with a later 
            time to return and ride. Only downside, by 10 am ALL fast passes were long gone. SO if you want to try and score some, make 
            sure to arrive here at 8:00 am!!</p>
